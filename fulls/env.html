            A customized development environment tailored to my workflow. This environment includes a collection of setup for Awesome WM, zsh, and Neovim running on Arch Linux operating system.
          </p>
          <p>
            This process gave me a chance to review my workflow, particularly when tracing others' code or working on my own projects. I identified areas that were taking up too much time and tried to improve their efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, I have been in the process of transitioning from Awesome WM to Hyprland, a Wayland-based window manager. Simultaneously, I am developing a desktop environment daemon to gather information and create a universal interface for my environment using Rust.
