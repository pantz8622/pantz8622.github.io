        <p class='main_paragraph'>A customized development environment tailored to my workflow. This environment includs a collection of setup for Awesome WM, zsh, and Neovim running on Arch Linux operating system.<br /><br />This process gave me a chance to review my workflow, particularly when tracing others' code or working on my own projects. I identified areas that were taking up too much time and tried to improve their efficiency.</p>
