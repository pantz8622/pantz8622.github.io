        <p>A self-designed single-cycle RISC-V CPU and a UART device on FPGA using Verilog, facilitating the execution of prebuilt executable code and output through the UART device.<br />This project involved a comprehensive design process, including hardware design & implementation, simulation, and verification.<br />This is a team effort, and I am primarily responsible for the CPU component's design and implementation.</p>
