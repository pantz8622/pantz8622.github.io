        <p class='main_paragraph'>A robotic vacuum cleaner built on FreeRTOS and Arduino UNO.<br />The design involves the repurposing of a portable fan and integration of several sensors and actuators, such as an ultrasonic distance sensor for collision detection, two gear motors for movement, a pressure sensor for load detection, and an infrared receiver for user commands. The main control logic is implemented using FreeRTOS within the Arduino UNO microcontroller.<br />This project marks my first experience applying academic knowledge to solving real-world problems.</p>
