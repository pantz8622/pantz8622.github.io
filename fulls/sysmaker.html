        <p class='main_paragraph'>An ongoing research focused on developing an auxiliary tool for designing embedded system.<br />This research proposes a tag-based approach to eliminate the gap between higher-level block diagrams and schematic diagrams. At the same time, it verifies the user's design and provides editing suggestions to improve the efficiency of the design flow.<br />My main role in this project is to create a multi-resolution hardware-software co-simulation model utilizing Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to verify designs created by Sysmaker.</p>
